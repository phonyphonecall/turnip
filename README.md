# :eggplant:

From google definitions:

`Turnip: informal. a large, thick, old-fashioned pocket watch.`

Turnip times operations, keeping average times within a timer. Useful for performance metrics over time.

The observant reader will note that :eggplant: is not a turnip. Unnforuntely there is no turnip emoji, so I did my best.
